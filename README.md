## Purpose

Provide solutions to the [Advent Of Code problems](http://adventofcode.com/) problems
using the Groovy Programming Language and a programming style that attempts to be as functional and idiomatic to Groovy as possible

Note that not much brainpower has gone into optimizing the execution time of the various solutions. As a result some solutions might take a fair amount time to run (for example problem 10)

## Prerequisites

Java 8 must be installed. No other software needs to be present

## Run

    $ ./gradlew -Pnumber=somenumber -q
    
Where `somenumber` is the number of the problem for which the solution should be shown
